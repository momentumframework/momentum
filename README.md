# Momentum Framework

Momentum is an open-source framework for building enterprise server-side Deno applications in TypeScript. It provides the paradigms and design patterns to guide developers to create robust, scalable, and enterprise-grade applications.
By focusing on a batteries-optional approach, Momentum provides a strong core that is easily extendable into a rich developer experience via dependency injection modules. While the framework is opinionated by design, this modular system aims to be unobtrusive and to allow developers to create abstraction layers over any codebase or third-party modules.
